# Pass-Roll
Rotate your passwords to make them relatively difficult to guess!

This is a browser extension developed for Chrome. It generates a circular GUI for rotating a password whenever type in a regular password-textbox on a Pass-Roll enabled website.

I developed this as part of the data security research at TCS Innovation Lab, Pune.

Browser extension is available to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pass-roll/finieofpmfjhijooekckemcmnlinkkbj?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon" target="_blank">download here</a>.
A variation of it called Pass-Scroll is available to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pass-scroll/ffjkcnhkmdgkabcdabiacjfppgfncmjb?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon" target="_blank">download here</a>.
